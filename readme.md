### Other

* [Wikipedia entry on Cython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cython).


## Software

### Cython implementation

- [Cython](https://github.com/cython/cython) ★5688 - "The most widely used Python to C compiler".
- [Cython+](https://lab.nexedi.com/nexedi/cython) - Fork of Cython by the Cython+ project.


### Cython librairies

*Librairies specifically designed to complement Cython*.

- [Cygnals](https://github.com/sagemath/cysignals) ★26 - cysignals: interrupt and signal handling for Cython.


### Alternatives

- [Pythran](https://github.com/serge-sans-paille/pythran) ★1477 - An ahead of time compiler for a subset of the Python language, with a focus on scientific computing. It takes a Python module annotated with a few interface description and turns it into a native Python module with the same interface, but (hopefully) faster.
- [Numba](https://github.com/numba/numba) ★5854 - A Just-In-Time Compiler for Numerical Functions in Python.


### Some projects with more that 10 000 lines of Cython code

- [Pandas](https://github.com/pydata/pandas) - A Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive.
- [scipy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy) - Open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. It includes modules for statistics, optimization, integration, linear algebra, Fourier transforms, signal and image processing, ODE solvers, and more.
- [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) - A Python module for machine learning built on top of SciPy.
- [scikit-image](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image.git) - Image processing in Python.

### Some projects with more that 1 000 lines of Cython code

- [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) - The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- [Cytoolz](https://github.com/pytoolz/cytoolz) - Cython implementation of Toolz: High performance functional utilities.
- [spaCy](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy) - Industrial-strength Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Python and Cython.
- [BlackSheep](https://github.com/RobertoPrevato/BlackSheep) - Fast ASGI web framework and HTTP client for Python asyncio.
