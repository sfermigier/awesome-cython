## Software

### Cython implementation

- [Cython](https://github.com/cython/cython) ★9144 - "The most widely used Python to C compiler".
- [Cython+](https://lab.nexedi.com/nexedi/cython) - Fork of Cython by the Cython+ project.


### Cython librairies

*Librairies specifically designed to complement Cython*.

- [Cygnals](https://github.com/sagemath/cysignals) ★44 - cysignals: interrupt and signal handling for Cython.
- [Pyrobuf](https://github.com/appnexus/pyrobuf) ★547 - an alternative to Google's Python Protobuf library, than generates lightning-fast Cython code that's 2-4x faster than Google's Python Protobuf library using their C++ backend and 20-40x faster than Google's pure-python implementation.


### Alternatives

- [Pythran](https://github.com/serge-sans-paille/pythran) ★1979 - An ahead of time compiler for a subset of the Python language, with a focus on scientific computing. It takes a Python module annotated with a few interface description and turns it into a native Python module with the same interface, but (hopefully) faster.
- [Numba](https://github.com/numba/numba) ★9612 - A Just-In-Time Compiler for Numerical Functions in Python.


### Some projects with more that 10 000 lines of Cython code

- [Pandas](https://github.com/pydata/pandas) ★42605 - A Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive.
- [scipy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy) ★12679 - Open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. It includes modules for statistics, optimization, integration, linear algebra, Fourier transforms, signal and image processing, ODE solvers, and more.
- [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) ★58793 - A Python module for machine learning built on top of SciPy.
- [spaCy](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy) ★29200 - Industrial-strength Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Python and Cython.

### Some projects with more that 5 000 lines of Cython code

- [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) ★27034 - The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- [Schrapnel](https://github.com/ironport/shrapnel) ★217 - Shrapnel is a scalable, high-performance cooperative threading library for Python.
- [scikit-image](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image) ★5941 - Image processing in Python.
- [lxml](https://github.com/lxml/lxml) ★2612 - The most feature-rich and easy-to-use library for processing XML and HTML in the Python language.
- [Pomegranate](https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate) ★3292 - Fast, flexible and easy to use probabilistic modelling in Python.

### Some projects with more that 1 000 lines of Cython code

- [BlackSheep](https://github.com/RobertoPrevato/BlackSheep) ★1799 - Fast ASGI web framework and HTTP client for Python asyncio.
- [pyimgui](https://github.com/swistakm/pyimgui) ★1308 - Python bindings for the amazing dear imgui C++ library - a Bloat-free Immediate Mode Graphical User Interface.
- [Antidote](https://github.com/Finistere/antidote) ★91 - Dependency injection for Python.
